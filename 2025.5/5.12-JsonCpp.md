# Using JsonCpp

what is json?

- not a language
-  a form to describe the data, arrange them by some certain data formatting
  - write to disk -> name: config
    - need to load a little data when a application start.
  - network send -> name: message

how dose json arrange data?

- json array
  - similar with C++: express with `[].`
  - difference: can contain difference data type.
  - **note**: don't add comma behind the last element.
- json object
  - express with `{}`
  - two parts: `key: value`
    - key: must be string type, the description of the data to be storage
    - value: the data to be storage.
